# Rtvals

Everything there is to know about rtvals.

At the moment there are four vals
- real -> for real/double/fractional numbers
- int -> for integer numbers
- text -> for general (ascii) sequences
- flag -> for binary true/false states

## Real & Int

These are meant to store numbers.  
Because these two have significant overlap, this is combined.

### Basics attributes
The most basic node, this is the absolute minimum required:
````xml
<rtvals>
  <real>name</real>
  <int>name</int>
  <!-- or -->
  <real name="name">
    <!-- add subnodes -->
  </real>
  <int name="name">
  </int>
</rtvals>
````
For the following examples an outdoor temperature reading will be used.  
Adding to this, the most often used:

````xml
<real group="outdoor" scale="2" unit="°C">temperature</real>
````
The added attributes:
- `group` The group the val belongs to, this is a way to combine different parameters from the same sensor/location etc
- `unit` The unit to append to the end on listings, default is none 
- `def` or `default` The default value to use if something went wrong or to start with
- `scale` The amount of digits (only applicable for real), default is 8

So in short this creates a real with the id `outdoor_temperature` with unit`°C` and rounded (half up) to two digits.

### Advanced attributes

At the moment there's only one `options`.
This attribute can be a list of other options to enable.  
These are:
- `time` Store the timestamp of the last update
- `minmax` Keep track of the minimum and maximum value (since startup)
- `history:x` Keep the last x values in memory, nothing is done with this for now except stdev calculations
- `stdev` Calculate the stdev based on the history
- `abs` Always store the absolute value instead
- `order:x` Just the position this val should get in the listing of the group

**Example:**  
````xml
<real group="outdoor" scale="2" unit="°C" options="minmax,history:5">temperature</real>
<!-- minmax will be calculated/stored and the last 5 values kept in memory -->
````

### Triggered Actions
It's possible to issue commands if a condition is met, this is the same for int and real.
````xml
<real group="outdoor" name="temperature" unit="°C">
    <!-- Always do this on an update -->
    <cmd when="always">cmd:arg1,$</cmd> <!-- $ will be replaced with the new value -->
    <cmd>command_to_execute</cmd>
    <!-- Only do this if the value changed -->
    <cmd when="changed">command_to_execute</cmd>
    <!-- Based on a comparison -->
    <cmd when="above 10">command_to_execute</cmd>
    <cmd when="below 5">command_to_execute</cmd>
    <!-- Other options are
        between 4.2 and 5.6
        5 through 10
        not below/above 6.6
        equals 10 
    -->
    <!-- Based on stdev comparison, requires history to be used -->
    <cmd when="stdev below 0.1">dosomething</cmd>
</real>
````
>Note: The reason this works with 'above' instead of '>' is because this violates XML syntax...

### Parsing

By default, if the val is used inside a store, the string is just converted to int/real. But this behaviour can be overridden.
````xml
<real group="outdoor" name="temperature" unit="°C">
    <!-- Instead of storing the value received, first add one -->
    <op>i0=i0+1</op>
</real>
````

## Text

### Basics attributes
The most basic node, this is the absolute minimum required:
````xml
<text>name</text>
<!-- or -->
<text name="name">
    <!-- add subnodes -->
</text>
````
````xml
<text group="outdoor" >temperature</text>
````
The added attributes:
- `group` The group the val belongs to, this is a way to combine different parameters from the same sensor/location etc
- `def` or `default` The default value to use if something went wrong or to start with

### Advanced attributes

At the moment there's only one `options`.
This attribute can be a list of other options to enable.  

These are:
- `time` Store the timestamp of the last update
- `history:x` Keep the last x values in memory, nothing is done with this for now except stdev calculations
- `order:x` Just the position this val should get in the listing of the group

### Triggered Actions

It's possible to issue commands if a condition is met, this is the same for int and real.
````xml
<text group="outdoor" name="temperature" >
    <!-- Always do this on an update -->
    <cmd when="always">cmd:arg1,$</cmd> <!-- $ will be replaced with the new value --> 
    <cmd>command_to_execute</cmd>
    <!-- Only do this if the value changed -->
    <cmd when="changed">command_to_execute</cmd>
</text>
````

### Parsing

By default, if the val is used inside a store, the string is just stored. But this behaviour can be overridden.
````xml
<text group="outdoor" name="temperature" >
    <parser key="012">No valid data</parser> <!-- So if new value is '012', the stored value will actually be 'No valid data' -->
    <parser key="013">No known sample</parser>
    <!-- To cover all other values because otherwise an error is given -->
    <keep>.*</keep>    <!-- Keep means that all values that don't match the earlier keys, will be stored untouched -->
    <keep regex=".*"/> <!-- Same as previous line -->
    <keep/>            <!-- Same as previous line -->
</text>
````

## Flag

### Basics attributes
The most basic node, this is the absolute minimum required:
````xml
<flag>name</flag>
<!-- or -->
<flag name="name">
    <!-- add subnodes -->
</flag>
````
````xml
<flag group="outdoor" >raining</flag>
````
The added attributes:
- `group` The group the val belongs to, this is a way to combine different parameters from the same sensor/location etc
- `def` or `default` The default state (true/false) to use if something went wrong or to start with

### Advanced attributes

At the moment there's only one `options`.
This attribute can be a list of other options to enable.

These are:
- `time` Store the timestamp of the last update
- `history:x` Keep the last x values in memory, nothing is done with this for now except stdev calculations
- `order:x` Just the position this val should get in the listing of the group

### Triggered Actions

It's possible to issue commands if a condition is met, this is the same for int and real.
````xml
<flag group="outdoor" name="raining" >
    <!-- Always do this on an update -->
    <cmd when="always">cmd:arg1,$</cmd> <!-- $ will be replaced with the new value --> 
    <cmd>command_to_execute</cmd>
    <!-- Only do this if the value changed -->
    <cmd when="changed">command_to_execute</cmd>
</flag>
````

### Parsing

By default, if the val is used inside a store, the parsing is like this:
- Convert to lowercase 
   - true,1,yes,high becomes true
   - false,0,no,low becomes false

This can be altered. Do note that:
- conversion to lower case is still applied
- true is always checked first and thus has priority.

So if true is a specific value, then false can be 'all' values which would be 'all except the one that's true'

Just like text earlier, all cases must be covered.  
Some examples:
````xml
<flag key="d20" name="d20" unit="">
    <!-- All rolls on a 20 sided die of at least 15 is true, rest are false -->
    <true>20</true><!-- default is a single value per node -->
    <true delimiter=",">15,16,17,18,19</true> <!-- but delimiter can be specified -->
    <false regex=".*"/> <!-- is also valid -->
    
    <!-- Or all rolls below 10 are false and above are true-->
    <true regex="\d{2}"/> <!-- Two digits -->
    <false regex="\d"/>   <!-- Single digit -->
</flag>
````

## Dynamic Units

If the values read have a wide range this isn't nice to display. So dynamic units were added so the values that
you see (but not those stored) are scaled.

Below is a full example with explanation.

```xml

<rtvals>
  <!-- Step based, so if starting with seconds, once this reaches 60 it's displayed as 1m then 1m1s and so on -->
  <unit base="s">
    <step cnt="60">m</step>
    <step cnt="60">h</step>
    </unit>
  <!-- Level based -->
  <!-- This is applied the moment the value passes the set max -->
  <!-- So 1001uA will become 1.001mA but scale is set to two, so 1mA -->
  <unit div="1000"> <!-- From one level to the next the division is 1000 -->
    <level max="1000">uA</level> <!-- Once max is passed, the next unit is used,max = div if not specified -->
    <level max="1500" scale="2">mA</level>
    <level>A</level> <!-- No max specified because the highest unit -->
    </unit>
</rtvals>
```
